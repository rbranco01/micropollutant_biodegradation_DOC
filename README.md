# micropollutant_biodegradation_DOC

This is repository contains the analysis of micropollutant removal, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) consumption, microbial activity and microbial growth of an experiment studying micropollutant removal by a soil and an aquifer activated communities. The dataset describes the temporal changes of micropollutant, DOC fractions, electron acceptor, bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes and *tfdA* gene concentrations under aerobic and nitrate reducing conditions as different DOC amendments are performed.

Chemical input data were obtained with liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer, liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection, gas chromatograph and ion chromatograph. Molecular biology input data were obtained with qPCR. The micropollutant, DOC fraction, electron acceptor and gene concentrations tables were imported into R (in input_data/). The unprocessed/untreated data used to create the R input data has also been included in the repository (in raw_data/).

For this study, primers targeting *tfdA* gene were designed. The qPCR primer design output files are also included in this repository (in qPCR_primer_design_output/).

This analysis was published as [**Branco et al. (2024)**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140644) in Chemosphere, titled *Effect of dissolved organic carbon on micropollutant biodegradation by aquifer and soil microbial communities*.
